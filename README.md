# Brain Tumor Detection Web App

This project is an **end-to-end brain tumor detection system** built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed as a **Streamlit web application**. The app predicts the type of brain tumor from MRI scans in real-time and maintains a dashboard log of predictions.

## Features

- Multi-class MRI classification: `No Tumor`, `Pituitary`, `Meningioma`, `Glioma`
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
- Dashboard to track all uploaded images and predictions
- Option to use a demo MRI image for testing
